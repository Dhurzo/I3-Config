Dhurzo's I3-GAPS  config
===================

This is my I3-GAPS ~~and I3 blocks config~~ Tint2 config.

Note: replace /home/juan with your home path

~~Note2: I3 blocks uses awesome fonts and some special icons.~~

I3Blocks was replaced by tint2 panel so to use this config install tint2 and place the new tint2rc in your config.

sudo apt-get install tint2
sudo apt-get install compton

install : https://github.com/trizen/menutray
